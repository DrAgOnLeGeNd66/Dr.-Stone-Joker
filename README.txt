# Dr. Stone Joker Mod for Balatro

A custom joker card mod inspired by the anime "Dr. Stone" that provides scaling multipliers based on stone cards in your deck.

## Features

- **Base Multiplier**: X2 Mult
- **Scaling Bonus**: +X0.2 for every Stone card in your deck
- **Dynamic Display**: Shows current multiplier value in real-time
- **Infinite Scaling**: No limit to how high the multiplier can go
- **Visual Design**: Custom sprite

## Installation

1. **Download the mod**: Extract the `Dr_Stone_Mod` folder
2. **Locate Balatro mods folder**:
   - **Steam**: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\`
   - **Standalone**: Look for `Mods` folder in your Balatro installation directory
3. **Install the mod**: Copy the entire `Dr_Stone_Mod` folder into your `Mods` directory
4. **Enable STEAMODDED**: Make sure you have STEAMODDED installed and enabled

## How It Works

### Base Functionality
- The Dr. Stone joker provides a base X2 multiplier to your score
- This multiplier is applied during the scoring phase of each hand

### Stone Card Synergy
- For every Stone card in your deck, the multiplier increases by X0.2
- Stone cards are created by various means in Balatro (certain jokers, spectral cards, etc.)
- The multiplier updates automatically when stone cards are added or removed

### Example Calculations
- 0 Stone cards: X2.0 Mult
- 1 Stone card: X2.2 Mult  
- 5 Stone cards: X3.0 Mult
- 10 Stone cards: X4.0 Mult
- 20 Stone cards: X6.0 Mult

## Strategy Tips

1. **Stone Card Generation**: Look for jokers and spectral cards that create stone cards
2. **Deck Management**: Consider keeping stone cards even if they don't contribute to scoring
3. **Synergy**: Combine with other multiplicative jokers for exponential scaling
4. **Long-term Investment**: The more stone cards you accumulate, the more powerful Dr. Stone becomes

## Technical Details

- **Rarity**: Uncommon (2)
- **Cost**: $6
- **Compatibility**: Works with Blueprint, Eternal, and Perishable
- **Real-time Updates**: Multiplier updates immediately when stone cards are added/removed
